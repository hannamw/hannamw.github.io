# About me
I'm Michael Hanna, a master's student in my second and final year of the <a href="https://lct-master.org/">Erasmus Mundus Language and Communications Technology</a> (LCT) dual-degree program. Last year, I was in Prague, studying at Charles University. This year, I'm living in Rovereto and studying at the University of Trento.

- **Urbanism**: I'm fascinated by the way that our built environment affects our lives. I'm a big fan of walkable neighborhoods, public transportation, and the power of well-designed spaces to bring people together.
