### Experience

#### Research Resident, Redwood Research 
January 2023
- Using mechanistic interpretability techniques to understand GPT-2's behavior, as part of the REMIX program

#### Research Assistant, Charles University, Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics 
December 2021 – Ongoing, Prague
- Researching the effect of reference translation quality on the reliability of machine translation metrics.

#### Intern, Charles University, Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics 
March 2021 – August 2021, Prague
- Used prompting to probe BERT for knowledge of hypernyms of common words.
- Conducted empirical experiments comparing BERT’s hypernym discovery performance to existing systems’.

#### Research Assistant, University of Chicago Dept. of Linguistics
January 2020 - June 2020, Chicago
- Used unsupervised clustering to test if ELMo embeddings of polysemous words were embedded in distinct clusters in the embedding space; this could allow for unsupervised learning of word senses.
- Used zero-shot probing tasks to explore the relationship between BERT’s (masked) language modeling abilities / pre-training and its high performance on down-stream tasks.

#### Software Engineering Intern, <a href='https://orbitalinsight.com/'>Orbital Insight</a>
Summer 2019, Boston
- Wrote monitors in Python to track and plot trends in data, and send alerts when anomalies were detected. Also wrote Dockerfiles for easy deployment to Kubernetes
- Used pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to analyze and quantify the accuracy of geospatial data from various sources, and ultimately decide which data provider to use.

#### Board Member, Board Manager (2019), <a href='https://splashchicago.learningu.org/'>Splash! Chicago</a>
Sept. 2016 – Jun. 2020, Chicago
- Led Splash! Chicago, a volunteer student group that organizes large (100-student) educational events where
high school students can learn from university students. Taught classes for Splash! Chicago in linguistics.

#### Grader, University of Chicago Dept. of Computer Science 			
Fall 2018 - July 2020, Chicago
- Graded the following courses: Intro to CS, Computer Systems, Computer Architecture, Time Series Analysis and Stochastic Processes

#### Student Programmer, <a href='http://stemed.uchicago.edu/'>University of Chicago STEM Education</a>
