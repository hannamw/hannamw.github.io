Hi—I'm Michael Hanna! I'm interested in interpreting and evaluating NLP models from a linguist's and cognitive scientist's point of view. Currently, I'm finishing my master's degrees through the <a href="https://lct-master.org/">EM LCT</a> dual-degree program at the University of Trento and Charles University. Once these are complete, I will begin a PhD at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/">ILLC</a> at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by <a href="https://sandropezzelle.github.io/">Sandro Pezzelle</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~belinkov/">Yonatan Belinkov</a>, through <a href="https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc">ELLIS</a>!

## Academic Interests
My main research interest is creating models with human-like abilities. I'm interested in approaching this goal by using linguistically-motivated **interpretability and analysis** methods to ask "How close are models' abilities to those of humans?". I'm also interested in **grounded NLP**, especially when that grounding goes beyond vision, to include additional modalities and embodiment. I'm excited about using ideas from linguistics and cognitive science to improve deep learning models and training regimes.

## Personal Interests
- **Living Abroad**: I've been lucky to participate in a number of programs, most of them free, that have allowed me to live in other countries and learn new ways of life. So far, I've lived for a year each in Spain (<a href='https://www.sya.org/'>SYA</a>), Czechia, and Italy (<a href='https://lct-master.org/'>LCT</a>), as well as a couple of summers in Korea (<a href='https://www.nsliforyouth.org/'>NSLI-Y</a>, <a href='https://study-abroad.uchicago.edu/summer-grant/foreign-language-acquisition-grant-flag'>FLAG</a>). If you're in high school or university and want to know more about opportunities like this, shoot me an email—I'm happy to share more info about programs that will let you live abroad for free!
- **Urbanism**: I'm fascinated by the way that our built environment affects our lives. I'm a big fan of walkable neighborhoods, public transportation, and the power of well-designed spaces to bring people together.
- **Vocal Performance**: During my undergrad, I was a baritone in <a href='http://runforcover.uchicago.edu/'>Run for Cover</a>, an a cappella group at UChicago. Check us out on <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/1WN22dBwn6fM3biZufox5W">Spotify</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/run-for-cover/id848631625">iTunes</a>!
