I'm Michael Hanna, a PhD student at the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Sandro Pezzelle](https://sandropezzelle.github.io/) and [Yonatan Belinkov](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~belinkov/), through [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/projects/interpreting-nlp-models-through-the-lens-of-cognition-and-linguistics). I'm interested in interpreting and evaluating NLP models by combining techniques from diverse fields such as cognitive science and mechanistic interpretability.

## Academic Interests
My main research interest, interpretability in the context of modern language models, is twofold. First, I'm interested in asking "What are the abilities of these models?" from a perspective informed by linguistics and cognitive science. In this so-called behavioral paradigm, I study these models on a pure input-output level, leveraging the wide body of psycholinguistic research conducted on humans. Second, I'm interested in answering "How do these models achieve such impressive performance on linguistic tasks?", using techniques from (mechanistic) interpretability. I use causal interventions to perform low-level studies of language models, uncovering the mechanisms that drive their behavior.

## Personal Interests
- **Living Abroad**: I've participated in a number of programs, most of them free, that have allowed me to live in other countries and learn new ways of life. I've spent time living in in Spain ([SYA](https://www.sya.org/)), Korea ([NSLI-Y](https://www.nsliforyouth.org/), [FLAG](https://study-abroad.uchicago.edu/summer-grant/foreign-language-acquisition-grant-flag)), Czechia, and Italy ([LCT](https://lct-master.org/)), the Netherlands, and (soon) Israel ([ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/)). If you're in high school or university and want to know more about opportunities like this, shoot me an email—I'm happy to share more info about programs that will let you live abroad for free!
- **Urbanism**: I'm fascinated by the way that our built environment affects our lives. I'm a big fan of walkable neighborhoods, public transportation, and the power of well-designed spaces to bring people together.
- **Vocal Performance**: During my undergrad, I was a baritone in [Run for Cover](http://runforcover.uchicago.edu/), an a cappella group at UChicago. Check us out on [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/artist/1WN22dBwn6fM3biZufox5W) or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/run-for-cover/id848631625)!
