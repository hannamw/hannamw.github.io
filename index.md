I'm a second and final year student in the <a href="https://lct-master.org/">Erasmus Mundus Language and Communications Technology</a> (LCT) dual-degree master's program. As part of LCT, I'm spending two years at two European universities, and obtaining two master's degrees. This year, I'm studying at the University of Trento, Italy. At UniTN, I'm working on projects at the intersection of grounded NLP, cognitive science, and neuroscience, with <a href='http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/'>Prof. Raffaella Bernardi</a>.

Last year, I studied at Charles University, in Prague. I worked on analyzing machine translation metrics with <a href='https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-bojar'>Prof. Ondrej Bojar</a> (<a href='https://www.statmt.org/wmt21/pdf/2021.wmt-1.59.pdf'>WMT 2021</a>), and analyzing BERT's knowledge of hypernymy with <a href='https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/david-marecek'>Prof. David Marecek</a> (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2021.blackboxnlp-1.20/'>BlackboxNLP 2021</a>). During my undergrad at UChicago, I studied Computer Science (specialization in machine learning) and Linguistics, graduating with honors in both. I wrote my honors thesis on interpreting variational autoencoders for sentences, advised by <a href='https://aetting.github.io/'>Prof. Allyson Ettinger</a>.

## Academic Interests
My main research interest is creating models with human-like abilities. I'm interested in approaching this goal by using linguistically-motivated **interpretability and analysis** methods to ask "How close are models' abilities to those of humans?". I'm also interested in **grounded NLP**, especially when that grounding goes beyond vision, to include additional modalities and embodiment. I'm excited about using ideas from linguistics and cognitive science to improve deep learning models and training regimes.

## Personal Interests
- **Living Abroad**: I've been lucky to participate in a number of programs, most of them free, that have allowed me to live in other countries and learn new ways of life. So far, I've lived for a year each in Spain (<a href='https://www.sya.org/'>SYA</a>), Czechia, and Italy (<a href='https://lct-master.org/'>LCT</a>), as well as a couple of summers in Korea (<a href='https://www.nsliforyouth.org/'>NSLI-Y</a>, <a href='https://study-abroad.uchicago.edu/summer-grant/foreign-language-acquisition-grant-flag'>FLAG</a>). If you're in high school or university and want to know more about opportunities like this, shoot me an emailâ€”I'm happy to share more info about programs that will let you live abroad for free!
- **Urbanism**: I'm fascinated by the way that our built environment affects our lives. I'm a big fan of walkable neighborhoods, public transportation, and the power of well-designed spaces to bring people together.
- **Vocal Performance**: During my undergrad, I was a baritone in <a href='http://runforcover.uchicago.edu/'>Run for Cover</a>, an a cappella group at UChicago. Check us out on <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/1WN22dBwn6fM3biZufox5W">Spotify</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/run-for-cover/id848631625">iTunes</a>!
