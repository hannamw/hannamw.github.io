## Personal Interests
- **Urbanism**: I'm fascinated by the way that our built environment affects our lives. I'm a big fan of walkable neighborhoods, public transportation, and the power of well-designed spaces to bring people together.
- **Vocal Performance**: During my undergrad, I was a baritone in Run for Cover, an a cappella group at UChicago. Check us out on <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/1WN22dBwn6fM3biZufox5W">Spotify</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/run-for-cover/id848631625">iTunes</a>!
