I'm Michael Hanna, a master's student in my second and final year of the <a href="https://lct-master.org/">Erasmus Mundus Language and Communications Technology</a> (LCT) dual-degree program. As part of LCT, I'm spending two years, at two European universities, and obtaining two master's degrees. This year, I'm living in Rovereto and studying at the University of Trento, Italy. At UniTN, I'm working on projects at the intersection of grounded NLP, cognitive science, and neuroscience, with <a href='http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/'>Prof. Raffaella Bernardi</a>.

Last year, I was in Prague, studying at Charles University. There, I worked on analyzing machine translation metrics with <a href='https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-bojar'>Prof. Ondrej Bojar</a> (<a href='https://www.statmt.org/wmt21/pdf/2021.wmt-1.59.pdf'>WMT 2021</a>), and analyzing BERT's knowledge of hypernymy with <a href='https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/david-marecek'>Prof. David Marecek</a> (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2021.blackboxnlp-1.20/'>BlackboxNLP 2021</a>). For my undergrad, I studied at UChicago, graduating with degrees with honors in Computer Science (with a specialization in machine learning) and Linguistics. I wrote my honors thesis on interpreting variational autoencoders for sentences, advised by <a href='https://aetting.github.io/'>Prof. Allyson Ettinger</a>.

## Academic Interests
- Natural Language Understanding
- Interpretability
- Grounded NLP


## Personal Interests
- **Urbanism**: I'm fascinated by the way that our built environment affects our lives. I'm a big fan of walkable neighborhoods, public transportation, and the power of well-designed spaces to bring people together.
- **Vocal Performance**: During my undergrad, I was a baritone in Run for Cover, an a cappella group at UChicago. Check us out on <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/1WN22dBwn6fM3biZufox5W">Spotify</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/run-for-cover/id848631625">iTunes</a>!
