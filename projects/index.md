### Learn Hangul
<img src="/assets/img/Thumb.png" width="140" height="140">
A learning game (think Duolingo) that teaches you Hangul / 한글, the Korean alphabet. The game is written entirely in Elm - a purely functional language designed for reliable webapps with no runtime exceptions.

This was developed as a project for CMSC 22300: Functional Programming. It does not yet include all elements of Hangul.

Play the demo [here](https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2019/spring/22300-1/showcase/mwhanna/index.html)!

### Othello
<img src="/assets/img/othello.png" width="140" height="140">

An implementation of the classic board game, Othello, in C. Play against a human, or a computer. The computer can be very hard to beat - at its hardest setting, it uses a minimax strategy that evaluates board states up to 6 moves in advance.

This program can found on <a href="https://github.com/hannamw/othello-in-c">github</a>, and is run from the command line.
