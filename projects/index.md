### Learn Hangul
A learning game (think Duolingo) that teaches you Hangul / 한글, the Korean alphabet. The game is written entirely in Elm - a purely functional language designed for reliable webapps with no runtime exceptions.

This was developed as a project for CMSC 22300: Functional Program. It does not yet include all elements of Hangul.

Play the demo [here](https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2019/spring/22300-1/showcase/mwhanna/index.html)!
